# NOTE: vite.config.ts currently has base: '/flowcraft/' for GitHub Pages.
# For GitLab Pages, if this project is in a repository root at https://gitlab.com/username/flowcraft/,
# the base path should remain '/flowcraft/'. However, if deployed to a user/group Pages site
# (like https://username.gitlab.io/), adjust vite.config.ts to base: '/'.
# Update as needed based on your GitLab Pages deployment URL.
