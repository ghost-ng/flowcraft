## JSON Import Rulebook

Chart Hero supports importing diagrams from JSON, and this format is designed to be generated by AI systems. The [JSON Import Rulebook](guides/FLOWCRAFT_JSON_IMPORT_RULEBOOK.md) is the authoritative specification that documents every supported field, valid values, sizing guidelines, and layout best practices. AI agents or code generators should follow this rulebook to produce diagrams that render correctly without manual adjustment.
